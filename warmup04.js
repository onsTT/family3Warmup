 //1- Write a JavaScript function that will iterate from n to 0. For each iteration,
 // it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.
 // iterateAndLog(3); =>
 // Sample Output :
 // "2 is even"
 // "1 is odd"
 // "0 is even"

function iterateAndLog(n) {

  // TODO: your work goes here

}

 // RECURSIVELY
 //2- Write a JavaScript program to get the first n Fibonacci numbers
 // That is, fib(0) is 1, fib(1) is 1, fib(2) is 2, fib(3) is 3, fib(4) is 5, etc.
 //  Notice that each fibonacci number can be computed by adding the previous two fibonacci numbers,
 //  with the exception of the first two: fib(0) and fib(1). More succinctly,
 //  fib(0) is 1
 //  fib(1) is 1
 //  fib(n) is fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
 //  Write a function called fib that accepts a number n as a parameter and computes the nth fibonacci number using the above rules.
 

function fib(number) {

  // TODO: your work goes here

}
//3.Write a function called sumOfFirstAndLast that 
//takes a number as a parameter and returns the sum of the first and last digits. Please do this without turning the number into a string.

function sumOfFirstAndLast(number) {
 
}
